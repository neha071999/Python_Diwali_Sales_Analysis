# Python_Diwali_Sales_Analysis
I have worked on this project in which there is a company that has given me its Diwali period data to perform Exploratory Data Analysis functions on its Diwali sales data. Data Analysis or sometimes referred to as exploratory data analysis (EDA) is one of the core components of data science. It is also the part on the majority of the time which makes it extremely important in the field of data science. This repository demonstrates Exploratory Data Analysis methods and techniques using Python.
This project involved data cleaning and manipulation, and Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries.
Through this project, I was able to identify potential customers across different states, occupations, gender, and age groups, which led to an improvement in customer experience. Additionally, I identified the most selling product categories and products, which helped to plan inventory and meet the demands, ultimately leading to an increase in sales.
